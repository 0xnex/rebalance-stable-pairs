## Strategy Overview

The Three-Band strategy is a concentrated liquidity market making approach designed for stablecoin pairs. It maintains 3-5 narrow price bands around the current price, rotating them as price moves to maintain coverage and capture trading fees.

**Core Metrics** (21-day backtest):

- **Base Return**: 0.791% (79.1 USDC on ~$10k)
- **Max Drawdown**: 0.012% (extremely low risk)
- **Annualized APY**: ~13.7%
- **Test Period**: August 20 - September 10, 2025

---

## Original Strategy

### Initialization / Deployment

- Split working capital into three contiguous micro-bands (‚âà¬±0.0008‚Äì0.001% around spot) so their tick ranges touch without gaps
- Open each band via `addLiquidityWithSwap` with a bootstrap slippage allowance to balance single-sided inventories if needed
- Track every band's `lastMoved` timestamp to support dwell protections later

### Monitoring Loop (30s fast / 60s slow)

- Define a fast set containing the closest `fastSegmentCount` bands (typically 1‚Äì2); inspect them every `fastIntervalMs` (30s)
- All remaining bands form the slow set, inspected every `slowIntervalMs` (60s)
- Skip inspections if the relevant interval has not elapsed
- Before a band moves, enforce the `minSegmentDwellMs` guard so it must stay in place for the configured duration (0‚Äì120s) before rotating again

### Rotation Logic

- If price lies inside any band, do nothing besides updating inspection timestamps
- **If price exits above the highest band:**
  1. Choose the lowest band from the fast or slow set whose interval has elapsed
  2. Remove liquidity (pay the action cost)
  3. Reopen the band immediately above the stack, preserving contiguity and updating `lastMoved`
- **If price exits below the lowest band**, mirror the process by rotating the highest band downward
- If no band satisfies both interval and dwell checks, skip the rotation and log a wait message instead of forcing a move
- Before and after rotations, call `manager.updateAllPositionFees()` so fee accounting remains current

### Protections & Cost Controls

- Every add/remove pays the configured action cost (default 0.02 token B) so performance metrics track net PnL
- Dwell guards prevent thrashing when price oscillates rapidly near the edges
- Slippage retry ladder escalates from `maxSwapSlippageBps` to `bootstrapMaxSwapSlippageBps`
- If all attempts fail, the original band is restored to avoid unintentionally dropping coverage
- The slow interval throttles outer rotations; even if price nudges outer bands, they only move when their slow cadence has elapsed unless promoted to the fast set

### Exit Process

- On completion, iterate through any active bands, remove liquidity (charging the action cost), and return all balances to the manager
- Ensure `feesOwed{0,1}` are zeroed so reports reflect only realized fees and final cash holdings

## Enhanced Features

Six enhancements were implemented to potentially improve performance. **Testing revealed mixed results** - see Performance Testing section.

### 1. Dynamic Capital Allocation

**Concept**: Allocate 60% of capital to the active band (containing current price), distribute remaining 40% based on distance to price.

**Implementation**:

```typescript
activeBandWeightPercent: 60; // Active band gets 60% of capital
```

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Slightly harmful in tested market** (-11% vs baseline)

**Reason**: In low-volatility markets with frequent price crossings, the overhead of reallocating 60% of capital between bands exceeded the benefit.

---

### 2. Adaptive Band Width

**Concept**: Adjust band width based on 10-minute rolling volatility. Tighten bands (0.5x-1x) in low volatility for more fees, widen (1x-2x) in high volatility to reduce rotations.

**Implementation**:

```typescript
volatilityWindowMs: 600_000; // 10-minute tracking window
```

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Slightly harmful in tested market** (-11% vs baseline)

**Reason**: Volatility calculations may have been noisy, leading to suboptimal band width adjustments.

---

### 3. Predictive Rotation

**Concept**: Rotate proactively when price approaches band edge (within 30%) based on momentum detection.

**Implementation**:

```typescript
momentumWindowSize: 5; // Track last 5 tick changes
```

**Status**: ‚ùå **Severely harmful** (-34% vs baseline)

**Reason**: In ranging markets with frequent reversals, preemptive rotations led to excessive unnecessary transactions and costs.

---

### 4. Fee Compounding

**Concept**: Automatically collect and reinvest fees when they exceed threshold (1% of position value).

**Implementation**:

```typescript
feeCompoundingThresholdPercent: 1.0;
```

**Status**: ‚âà **Neutral** (0% impact in 21-day test)

**Reason**: Threshold too high - never triggered in short test period. Long-term potential but no short-term impact.

---

### 5. Smart Slippage Management

**Concept**: Calculate optimal slippage based on position size relative to pool depth.

**Implementation**: Automatic calculation in `buildSlippageAttempts()`

**Status**: ‚âà **Neutral** (0% impact)

**Reason**: Position size too small relative to pool - optimization space negligible.

---

### 6. Fee Velocity-Based Rotation

**Concept**: Only rotate positions that have earned enough fees to justify the rotation cost (1.5x buffer).

**Implementation**: Integrated into `canRotate()` decision logic

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Included in Dynamic Allocation impact**

**Reason**: Hard to isolate but contributes to overall complexity.

## Performance Testing Results

### Comprehensive Test Results (21 days, Aug 20 - Sep 10, 2025)

| Configuration                         | Return     | vs Baseline | Status          |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| **Baseline (all disabled)**           | **0.791%** | -           | ‚úÖ **Best**     |
| + Fee Compounding + Smart Slippage    | 0.791%     | 0%          | ‚âà Neutral       |
| + Dynamic Allocation + Adaptive Width | 0.698%     | -12%        | ‚ö†Ô∏è Harmful      |
| + Predictive Rotation (all enabled)   | 0.408%     | -48%        | ‚ùå Very harmful |

### Key Findings

1. **Predictive Rotation is severely harmful** in ranging/oscillating markets

   - Causes premature rotations
   - Price reversals make preemptive moves wasteful
   - Cost of extra transactions exceeds any benefit

2. **Dynamic Allocation + Adaptive Width are mildly harmful**

   - 60% concentration too aggressive for low-volatility
   - Frequent rebalancing costs exceed incremental fee capture
   - Better suited for trending markets

3. **Fee Compounding + Smart Slippage are neutral**

   - Fee threshold too high to trigger in short test
   - Position size too small for slippage optimization
   - No harm but no help either

4. **Simple is better** - the baseline configuration outperformed all "enhancements"

### Risk Metrics

- **Max Drawdown**: 0.012% (extremely low)
- **Risk-Adjusted Return**: 66:1 ratio (return/drawdown)
- **Stability**: Consistent positive returns

## Recommended Configuration

### ‚úÖ Recommended: Pure Baseline (Best Performance)

```typescript
const config = {
  // Core parameters
  segmentCount: 3,
  segmentRangePercent: 0.001, // 0.1% width

  // Time controls
  fastIntervalMs: 30_000, // 30 seconds
  slowIntervalMs: 300_000, // 5 minutes
  minSegmentDwellMs: 120_000, // 2 minutes
  minOutOfRangeMs: 120_000, // 2 minutes

  // Cost controls
  actionCostTokenA: 0,
  actionCostTokenB: 0.02,
  minRotationProfitTokenB: 0.05,

  // Slippage
  maxSwapSlippageBps: 50,
  bootstrapMaxSwapSlippageBps: 200,
  bootstrapAttempts: 3,

  // Enhanced features - ALL DISABLED
  enableDynamicAllocation: false,
  enableAdaptiveBandWidth: false,
  enablePredictiveRotation: false,
  enableFeeCompounding: false,
  enableSmartSlippage: false,
};
```

**Expected Performance**: 0.791% per 21 days (~13.7% APY)

### Alternative: Conservative Enhancement (Optional)

If you want to keep some features for specific conditions:

```typescript
{
  // Disable harmful features
  enableDynamicAllocation: false,
  enableAdaptiveBandWidth: false,
  enablePredictiveRotation: false,  // Never enable in ranging markets

  // Keep neutral features (won't hurt)
  enableFeeCompounding: true,
  enableSmartSlippage: true,

  // Adjust compounding for long-term
  feeCompoundingThresholdPercent: 0.5,  // Lower threshold
}
```

## Key Learnings

### 1. ‚úÖ Simplicity Often Wins

The baseline strategy (0.791%) outperformed all "enhanced" versions:

- Fewer moving parts = fewer failure modes
- Lower complexity = lower costs
- Proven reliability over theoretical optimization

### 2. ‚úÖ Market Context Matters

Enhancements designed for one market type may harm performance in another:

- **Predictive Rotation**: Good for trends, bad for ranging
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Good for stable bands, bad for frequent crossings
- **Adaptive Width**: Needs clean volatility signal, not noisy markets

### 3. ‚úÖ Testing is Critical

Theoretical improvements must be validated:

- Our testing revealed that "optimizations" can be "de-optimizations"
- Always compare against baseline
- Test in multiple market conditions

### 4. ‚úÖ Cost Awareness

Every operation has a cost:

- Rotation cost: 0.02 Token B per operation
- Frequent adjustments can exceed incremental gains
- Sometimes doing less is doing more

### 5. ‚úÖ When Enhancements May Help

The tested enhancements might work better in:

- **Trending markets** (for predictive rotation)
- **Higher volatility** (for adaptive width)
- **Larger capital** (for smart slippage)
- **Longer timeframes** (for fee compounding)
- **Different pools** (different characteristics)

- Increase `minSegmentDwellMs`
- Increase `minRotationProfitTokenB`
- Widen bands (`segmentRangePercent`)
- Ensure predictive rotation is disabled

### Higher Drawdown

**Solutions**:

- Reduce segment count
- Widen bands
- Ensure all enhancements disabled
